# Corda Training Template
This repo contains material for the Corda two day training course. This course can be optionally prefaced by the content found in the hello-corda directory in the root of this repository.

This repository is divided into two parts: Java templates, and Kotlin templates. You may complete the training in whichever 
language you prefer.
